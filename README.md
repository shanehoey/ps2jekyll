# ps2jekyll

## About

A simple script that will document a PowerShell module and turn each function into a Markdown file that can then be uploaded to a Jekyll website. This script is purpose built to document my modules into MarkDown that can be used in Jekyll

## Examples

For an example of the output of this script in Jekyll visit https://shanehoey.github.io/worddoc/docs/

##Credits

This script was written from scratch, however prior to this script I used  [psdoc](https://github.com/ChaseFlorell/psDoc/) by Chase Florell. Reccommend you try Chase's script as it is more flexible than ps2jekyll.
